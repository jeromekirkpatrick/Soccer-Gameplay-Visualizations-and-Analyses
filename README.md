# capstone-3

I want to continue working with soccer data from Statsbomb. I want to work on my visualization and prediction skills.

I think there was a lot left undone in my Capstone 2 as far as predicting expected goals (xg), so I want to continue working on tuning and trying different models. I'd like to try neural networks this time in addition to trying to tune my regression, random forest, and gradient boosting models, and work more on feature selection/engineering.

I want to work on what I showed

Plus:

For predictions:
-Add predictions for xg for each team
-Add predictions for xg for each player
-Add prediction for winner of game

Stretch goal:
-Add predictions of threat based on play

For visualizations I want to add on top of each play as demoed:
-Add chain of possession instead of only individual play so there's a rolling visual of last few or so plays
-Dynamic visualization of xg stats to see how shots are impacting the predicted winner of the game

Stretch goal:
-Add visualizations of expected threat

Thanks!
